# ACM PDEU Chapter Website:

Structure of the website will be as follows:
i) Navbar
ii) Hero Section
iii) About Us Section
iv) Team Section
v) Contact Section

Folder structure is very simple:

- Approach is to divide entire site into containers and the containers to further reusable components.
- Context folder will be there to manage the global state of the website (will implement in future during toggle theme).
